Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we have compiled a prerequisites document detailing 
    how to install it, which will be sent out before the workshop.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regardless of how you choose to install it,
    <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
    (but we recommend using 3.8)

    We will teach Python using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>,
    a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
    up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
    Firefox browsers are all
    <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
    (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
    and below, are not).
